Project Timeline (7 Days)
Day 1: Planning and Setup

    Set up your development environment.
    Create a basic project layout.
    Decide on the libraries and frameworks to use.
    Draft a simple project plan or list of features.

    Encrypt
    Hash
    Auth
    I want to log in with email and master password. Go to a dashboard where I can see my current passwords, edit/delete passwords and add/generate new passwords. I want to see a sidebar navigation, and two "windows", one window is for displaying info, the second window shows up to make changes.

Day 2: UI Design and Basic Backend Structure

    Design the initial UI layout using your chosen Python UI framework.
    Create basic backend classes/functions (e.g., for handling database interactions, encryption logic).

Day 3: Implementing Core Features

    Start building core functionalities:
        User registration and login.
        Database integration for storing encrypted passwords.
    Write unit tests for these functionalities.

Day 4: Advanced Features and Testing

    Implement more advanced features:
        Password retrieval.
        Password generation.
        Secure password storage.
    Conduct further testing and refine unit tests.

Day 5: Integrating UI with Backend

    Connect the UI elements with backend logic.
    Ensure seamless data flow between the frontend and backend.
    Begin basic testing of the integrated application.

Day 6: Refinement and Additional Features

    Refine UI based on functionality.
    Add any additional features (like search, categorize passwords, etc.).
    Conduct comprehensive testing including UI testing.

Day 7: Final Testing, Documentation, and Packaging

    Conduct final testing, including stress tests and security checks.
    Document the code and usage instructions.
    Package the application for distribution.
